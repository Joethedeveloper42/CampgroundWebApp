# CampgroundWebApp
Created a web app from online boot camp

This is a completed web application that I built during a full stack web development bootcamp. 
It is built using Node, MongoDB and Express, as well as several other npm packages that were useful for this application, such as passport and body-parser. This allowed for user authentication and managing user sessions. 

The functionality also allows the ability to add campgrounds, photos and descriptions, as well as leaving comments. These can all be edited, and the web application was built with RESTful routes in mind.
